- `services/` - System service definitions and scripts
- `config/` - Init system configuration
- `scripts/` - Service management scripts

## Features

- Minimal and efficient system initialization
- Service dependency management
- Parallel service startup
- System state management
- Service monitoring and recovery

## Implementation

### Core Init
- System initialization sequence
- Hardware detection and setup
- Filesystem mounting
- Network initialization

### Service Management
- Service startup/shutdown control
- Dependency resolution
- Service status monitoring
- Resource management
